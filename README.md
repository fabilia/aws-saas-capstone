# **Insights from the AWS SaaS Sales Dataset: Underlying Problems and How to Solve Them**

This github was created to meet the requirements of Purwadhika's DTI Data Science program for Capstone Project 2. Using the AWS SaaS Sales Dataset, I formulated a series of problems based on the business needs and challenges faced by the company. As this project emphasizes data analysis, I assumed the role of a data analyst within the company.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally [(Amazon, 2024)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/).
 As cloud computing has evolved, AWS has emerged as a top choice, providing a diverse mix of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions.

SaaS, or Software-as-a-Service, is a method of delivering applications over the Internet as a service [(Salesforce, 2024)](https://www.salesforce.com/ap/saas/). Instead of installing and maintaining software, users access it via the Internet, eliminating the complexities of software and hardware management. According to a [Canalys study](https://www.canalys.com/insights/hyperscale-cloud-marketplaces-saas-channels), cloud marketplaces are emerging as the fastest-growing route to market for SaaS software, projected to reach $45 billion by 2025, with an 84% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over five years.

In Q1 2024, major cloud providers AWS, Google, Alibaba, Salesforce, Microsoft, and others competed in a $76 billion market [(Haranas, 2024)](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2024/aws-google-microsoft-battle-over-76b-q1-cloud-market-share?page=6). Amazon maintains a strong lead, holding a 31% market share, though Microsoft and Google showed stronger year-on-year growth at 25% and 11% respectively [(Synergy Research Group, 2024)](https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/huge-cloud-market-sees-a-strong-bounce-in-growth-rate-for-the-second-consecutive-quarter).

Despite AWS's leading position, its market share decreased from 33% in 2022 [(Synergy Research Group, 2022)](https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/02/cloud_market_share_q1_2022/) to 31% in 2024 [(Synergy Research Group, 2024)](https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/huge-cloud-market-sees-a-strong-bounce-in-growth-rate-for-the-second-consecutive-quarter). While this decline might seem minor, it is concerning given the competitive landscape. If AWS is inattentive to what is currently happening, other companies can take their throne. To address this, AWS must detect underlying problems and implement effective strategies to maintain and potentially increase its market share.
