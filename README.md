# **Insights from the AWS SaaS Sales Dataset: Underlying Problems and How to Solve Them**

This github was created to meet the requirements of Purwadhika's DTI Data Science program for Capstone Project 2. Using the AWS SaaS Sales Dataset, I formulated a series of problems based on the business needs and challenges faced by the company. As this project emphasizes data analysis, I assumed the role of a data analyst within the company.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally [(Amazon, 2024)](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-aws/).
 As cloud computing has evolved, AWS has emerged as a top choice, providing a diverse mix of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions.

SaaS, or Software-as-a-Service, is a method of delivering applications over the Internet as a service [(Salesforce, 2024)](https://www.salesforce.com/ap/saas/). Instead of installing and maintaining software, users access it via the Internet, eliminating the complexities of software and hardware management. According to a [Canalys study](https://www.canalys.com/insights/hyperscale-cloud-marketplaces-saas-channels), cloud marketplaces are emerging as the fastest-growing route to market for SaaS software, projected to reach $45 billion by 2025, with an 84% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over five years.

In Q1 2024, major cloud providers AWS, Google, Alibaba, Salesforce, Microsoft, and others competed in a $76 billion market [(Haranas, 2024)](https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/2024/aws-google-microsoft-battle-over-76b-q1-cloud-market-share?page=6). Amazon maintains a strong lead, holding a 31% market share, though Microsoft and Google showed stronger year-on-year growth at 25% and 11% respectively [(Synergy Research Group, 2024)](https://www.srgresearch.com/articles/huge-cloud-market-sees-a-strong-bounce-in-growth-rate-for-the-second-consecutive-quarter).

Details are under construction. Last notebook update: 04/06/2024.
